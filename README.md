# üêô‚ö†Ô∏èüè∑ GitHub Actions + Danger + Milestones example

This repo shows how to write a GitHub Actions [workflow](https://github.com/mokagio/github-action-milestone-workflow-example/blob/e65436a60b843a69e2110127554747b941597b20/.github/workflows/check-pr-milestone.yml) that is triggered when
the milestone of a pull request changes.

Play around with the milestone in [this issue](https://github.com/mokagio/github-action-milestone-workflow-example/issues/1) and [this PR](https://github.com/mokagio/github-action-milestone-workflow-example/pull/2) to verify the configuration.
